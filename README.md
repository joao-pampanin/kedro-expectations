# kedro-expectations
A tool to better integrate Kedro and Great Expectations

## Introduction

Kedro Expectaions is a tool designed to make the use of Great Expectations within ProjetaAi projects easier. It is composed of a couple commands and a hook, allowing the user create suites and run validations based on the DataCatalog and using directly the Kedro input as it's called by the normal pipeline

## Features

- ‚è≥ Initialization of GE without having to worry about datasources
- üéØ Creation of GE suites automatically, using the Data Assistant
- üöÄ Running validations within the Kedro pipeline

## Installation

For now, the plugin can only be installed through this github repo, but soon it will be available at PyPI

## Usage

### CLI Usage

The first step to use the plugin is running an init command. This command will create the base GE folder and create the only datasource the plugin needs

```bash
kedro expectations init
```

After the init command the plugin is ready to create expectation suites. It is possible to create expectation suites for Non-spark dataframe objects (there is no need to worry about file extension since Kedro Expectations gets all it needs from the Kedro input) and ProjetaAi Partitioned datasets

Within partitioned datasets, it is possible to create generic expectations, meaning all the partitions will use that expectation, or specific expectations, meaning only the specified partition will use the generated expectation

Run the following command to create expectations suites:

```bash
kedro expectations create-suite
```

### Hook Usage

In order to enable the hook capabilities you only need to call it in the settings.py file inside your kedro project

(inside src/your_project_name/settings.py)
```bash
from kedro_expectations import KedroExpectationsHooks

HOOKS = (KedroExpectationsHooks(fail_fast=False),)
```

### Fail Fast

fail_fast is a parameter added to allow a great expectations validation failure to break the pipeline run. It is useful when you want your pipeline to keep running only if GE doesn't find any incoherences at any validation

Its default value is "False", and to change it the only step necessary is to change the parameter value within your hook usage

```bash
HOOKS = (KedroExpectationsHooks(fail_fast=True),)
```

## Example

To make things clearer, the following example will approach the most complex usage of the plugin, which is when we want to create an specific expectation for a partitioned dataset

This example was made using ProjetaAi's Partitioned Iris Starter

### Init and Suite Creation

The first step to use the plugin is to use the "kedro expectations init" command. Below we can see the expected result:

</p>

As soon as it is created, we can run the second command: "kedro expectations create-suite"
You will be prompted to choose between (1) suites for generic datasets and (2) suites for partitioned datasets:

  <img src="https://github.com/joao-pampanin/kedro-expectations/blob/develop/images/3_createsuite.png">
</p>

Then we can choose between a generic or an specific expectation. In this example, we will press (2) to create an specific one:

</p>

Now the plugin will ask three questions. The first two must be answered based on your project, and the last one is any name based on your preference

Our partitioned dataset structure inside the project:

Questions asked by the CLI:

</p>

The last step is to decide if we want to exclude some columns from the expectation suite. Whenever you selected you desired columns, type "0" (without quote marks):

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/joao-pampanin/kedro-expectations/blob/develop/images/6_createsuite.png">
</p>

Then your dataset will be validated automatically and will be found at great_expectations/expectations/"your_dataset_name"/"your_expectation_name"

</p>

### Adding the Hook

Now, to be able to test, we only need to add 2 lines of code in our settings.py file:

</p>

### Running the Kedro project

After adding the Hook there is no extra step. You can simply run the project by typing the normal "kedro run" command. Whenever a dataset with an expectation suite is called by the pipeline, Kedro Expectations will validade it and add the results to the data_docs
